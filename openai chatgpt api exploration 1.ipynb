    "# OpenAI ChatGPT's API Exploration 1\n",
    "### Jeremy Bloom\n",
    "### 2024.02.24 v1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my first walkthrough and exploration of OpenAI's API via the [OpenAI Python API](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).   Some of this compares to my first HuggingFace walthrough/exploration, but this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, as with HuggingFace I was just trying out several (much smaller) open source models locally and this walk through is relying on OpenAI's chatGPT which is a huge model that's been fine tuned in many ways for many different tasks and is running on OpenAI's infrastucture.  (There are other differences too.) \n",
    "\n",
    "I put this together to help friends and colleagues better understand what is possible in AI, ML, and particularly with transformer architectures and LLMs.  Those with little to no programming experience can still probably follow the [video](https://youtu.be/LZc_MeruynY), as I try to explain what's happening.  For those who code, I suggest downloading the notebook and putting the video on in the background as you work through it yourself.  You can also just talk directly to [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This content is a mix of my own exploration plus several examples from or inspired by [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/) at deeplearning.ai by Isa Ford of OpenAI and Andrew Ng of deeplearning.ai.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook and the [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/tuWF-uCjbzM) are my own, as are any and all errors.\n"

    "# 1. Getting Started\n",
    "To use the api you'll need to purchase some credits.  I've been playing with chatGPT for hours and spent about 12 cents already, so you can start with the minimum purchase which I think is $5 one-time cost.  Check out [pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) to pay and get an OPENAI_API_KEY.  Note that I mostly stick to the discount model, gpt-3.5-turbo, which is charged by token.  If tokens are new to you, most tokens are small words or parts of words, such that you'll typically use 2-3 tokens for every word you use.  By my math, 1 cent gets you 200,000 input tokens or 66,000 output tokens.  So if you input a 10,000 word article and ask for a 1,000 word summary you might spend close to 1/5th of a cent.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need to install the [openai python library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) with your favorite package manager or or use `pip install openai`\n",
    "\n",
    "In conda, I did this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name mynewenv`<br>\n",
    "`conda activate mynewenv`<br>\n",
    "`conda install openai`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get your API key add it to your environment with something like export `OPENAI_API_KEY=\"blah\"`.  Yeah, you could hardcode it, but you're better than that."

    "The order Anura includes the frogs and toads. They are the most successful living amphibia, judged by number of species. There are about 7400 different species of amphibians, and about 6500 are in the Anura.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no fundamental difference between frogs and toads. Frogs have a short body, webbed digits (fingers or toes), protruding eyes, forked tongue and no tail. They are exceptional jumpers: many of their features, particularly their long, powerful legs, are adaptations to improve jumping performance. They often live in semi-aquatic or humid areas.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular distinction is often made between frogs and toads on the basis of their appearance. The warty skin of toads is an adaptation for making their toxic slime. Apart from these glands, their skin is dry, and that is an adaptation to drier habitats. These features have evolved a number of times independently: convergent evolution. The distinction has no taxonomic basis: the Anura are not divided into frogs and toads.
